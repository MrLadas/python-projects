# Bind configuration generator
This is a script to simplify the basic configuration of a local Bind DNS server.

## Work in Progress
* This is a project I did for "fun", and it should go without saying is not a production ready tool. In its current state many assumptions have been made about how bind is configured on your setup.
* Generally this should work on a basic fresh installation of bind, for a local network. 
* The intent of this project was for my personal learning, and it grew into something that might be useful to some people.
